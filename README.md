### Working with docker

- Build a faucet

```sh
docker build -t gotabit-faucet .
```

- Version and help

```sh
docker run --rm gotabit-faucet version
docker run --rm gotabit-faucet help
```

- Run faucet locally

```sh
docker run  -d  -p 8000:8000   \
  --name faucet \
  -e FAUCET_MNEMONIC="<YOUR MNEMONIC>" \
  -e FAUCET_TOKENS=ugio,uusd  \
  -e FAUCET_ADDRESS_PREFIX=gio \
  -e FAUCET_GAS_PRICE=0.000001ugio \
  gotabit-faucet  \
  start "http://localhost:26657"
```

### Using the faucet

Now that the faucet has been started up, you can send credit requests to it.
This can be done with a simple http POST request. These commands assume the
faucet is running locally, be sure to change it from `localhost` if your
situation is different.

```
curl --header "Content-Type: application/json" \
  --request POST \
  --data '{"denom":"ugio","address":"ugio1yre6ac7qfgyfgvh58ph0rgw627rhw766y430qq"}' \
  http://localhost:8000/credit
```

### Checking the faucets status

The faucet provides a simple status check in the form of an http GET request. As
above, make sure to adjust the URL as necessary.

```
curl http://localhost:8000/status
```
